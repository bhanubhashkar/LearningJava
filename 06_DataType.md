## Data Types in Java
Data types are divided into two groups:

1. Primitive data types : includes byte, short, int, long, float, double, boolean and char
2. Non-primitive (Reference) data types : such as String, Arrays and Classes
* The var keyword lets the compiler automatically detect the type of a variable based on the value you assign to it.

> Primitive data types store simple values directly in memory. Java provides eight primitive data types, each with a fixed size and range. A primitive data type specifies the type of a variable and the kind of values it can hold.

There are eight primitive data types in Java:
* Data Type	Description
1. byte	    Stores whole numbers from -128 to 127
2. short	Stores whole numbers from -32,768 to 32,767
3. int	    Stores whole numbers from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647
4. long	    Stores whole numbers from -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807
5. float	Stores fractional numbers. Sufficient for storing 6 to 7 decimal digits
6. double	Stores fractional numbers. Sufficient for storing 15 to 16 decimal digits
7. boolean	Stores true or false values
8. char	    Stores a single character/letter or ASCII values

> A non-primitive data type Store memory references to objects. These types are created by the programmer (except for String) and store references (memory addresses) to objects on the heap memory, rather than the values themselves. They can also access methods and default to null if uninitialized.
* Data Type	Description
1. String   Represents a sequence of characters enclosed in double quotes. String cannot be modified after creation
2. Array    Stores multiple elements of the same type in a single structure. Array are objects, dynamically allocated, and indexed from 0.
3. Class    User-defined blueprint that defines variables and methods. Represents a type of object and forms the foundation of Object-Oriented Programming.
4. Object   An instance of a class representing real-world entities. It has state (data), behavior (methods), and identity (unique reference).
