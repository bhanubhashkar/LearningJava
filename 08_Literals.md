## Literals
> In Java, a literal is a fixed, constant value that is written directly into the source code. These values do not change during the execution of a program and are used to initialize variables or define constant expressions.
For example, in the statement int age = 25;, the value 25 is an integer literal. 


## Operators
> In Java, operators are special symbols used to perform operations on variables and values. They are the fundamental tools for implementing logic, computation, and control flow in a program. 

* Java operators are categorized by their function: 
1. Arithmetic   : Perform basic math (+, -, *, /, %).
2. Relational   : Compare values, returning a boolean (==, !=, >, <, >=, <=).
3. Logical      : Combine boolean expressions (&&, ||, !).
4. Assignment   : Assign values (=, +=, -=, etc.).
5. Unary        : Act on single operands, including increment/decrement (++, --) and negation (-, !).
6. Bitwise & Shift : Operate on individual bits (&, |, ^, ~, <<, >>, >>>).
7. Ternary      : A compact if-else shortcut (? :).
8. instanceof   : Tests object type.
